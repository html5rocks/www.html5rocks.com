<h2 id="toc-intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>Audio is a huge part of what makes multimedia experiences so
compelling. If you've ever tried watching a movie with the sound off,
you've probably noticed this.</p>
<p>Games are no exception! My fondest video game memories are of the music
and sound effects. Now, in many cases nearly two decades after playing
my favorites, I still can't get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koji_Kondo">Koji Kondo</a>'s Zelda
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qJ-xEZhGms">compositions</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Uelmen">Matt Uelmen</a>'s atmospheric <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2evIg-aYw8">Diablo
soundtrack</a> out of my head. The same catchiness applies to sound
effects, such as the instantly recognizable unit click responses from
Warcraft, and samples from Nintendo's classics.</p>
<p>Game audio presents some interesting challenges. To create convincing
game music, designers need to adjust to  potentially unpredictable game
state a player finds themselves in. In practice, parts of the game can
go on for an unknown duration, sounds can interact with the environment
and mix in complex ways, such as room effects and relative sound
positioning. Finally, there can be a large number of sounds playing at
once, all of which need to sound good together and render without
introducing performance penalties.</p>
<h2 id="toc-audio">Game Audio on the Web</h2>

<p>For simple games, using the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag may be sufficient. However, many
browsers provide poor implementations, which result in audio glitches
and high latency. This is hopefully a temporary problem, since vendors
are working hard to improve their respective implementations. For a
glimpse into the state of the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag, there is a nice test suite
at <a href="http://areweplayingyet.org/">areweplayingyet.org</a>.</p>
<p>Looking deeper into the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag specification, however, it becomes
clear that there are many things that simply can't be done with it,
which isn't surprising, since it was designed for media playback. Some
limitations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No ability to apply filters to the sound signal</li>
<li>No way to access the raw PCM data</li>
<li>No concept of position and direction of sources and listeners</li>
<li>No fine-grained timing.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the rest of the article, I'll dive into some of these topics in the
context of game audio written with the Web Audio API. For a brief
introduction to this API, take a look at the <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/">getting started
tutorial</a>.</p>
<h2 id="toc-bg">Background music</h2>

<p>Games often have background music playing on a loop. For example, a
background track like:</p>
<p><audio controls loop>
<source src="res/nyan.wav">
</audio></p>
<p>can get very annoying if your loop is short and predictable. If a player
is stuck in an area or level, and the same sample continuously plays in
the background, it may be worthwhile to gradually fade out the track to
prevent further frustration. Another strategy is to have mixes of
various intensity that gradually crossfade into one another, depending
on the context of the game.</p>
<p>For example, if your player is in a zone with an epic boss battle, you
might have several mixes varying in emotional range from atmospheric to
foreshadowing to intense. Music synthesis software often allows you to
export several mixes (of the same length) based on a piece by picking
the set of tracks to use in the export. That way you have some internal
consistency and avoid having jarring transitions as you cross-fade from
one track to another.</p>
<p><img alt="garageband" src="res/garageband.png" /></p>
<p>Then, using the Web Audio API, you can import all of these samples using
something like the <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/js/buffer-loader.js">BufferLoader class</a> via XHR (this is
covered in depth in the <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/">introductory Web Audio API article</a>.
Loading sounds takes time, so assets that are used in the game should be
loaded on page load, at the start of the level, or perhaps incrementally
while the player is playing.</p>
<p>Next, you create a source for each node, and a gain node for each
source, and connect the graph as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="background-graph" src="res/background.png" /></p>
<p>After doing this, you can play back all of these sources simultaneously
on a loop, and since they are all the same length, the Web Audio API
will guarantee that they will remain aligned. As the character gets
nearer or further from the final boss battle, the game can vary the gain
values for each of the respective nodes in the chain, using a gain
amount algorithm like the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>// Assume gains is an array of AudioGainNode, normVal is the intensity
// between 0 and 1.
var value = normVal * (gains.length - 1);
// First reset gains on all nodes.
for (var i = 0; i &lt; gains.length; i++) {
  gains[i].gain.value = 0;
}
// Decide which two nodes we are currently between, and do an equal
// power crossfade between them.
var leftNode = Math.floor(value);
// Normalize the value between 0 and 1.
var x = value - leftNode;
var gain1 = Math.cos(x * 0.5*Math.PI);
var gain2 = Math.cos((1.0 - x) * 0.5*Math.PI);
// Set the two gains accordingly.
gains[leftNode].gain.value = gain1;
// Check to make sure that there's a right node.
if (leftNode &lt; gains.length - 1) {
  // If there is, adjust its gain.
  gains[leftNode + 1].gain.value = gain2;
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the above approach, two sources play at once, and we crossfade
between them using equal power curves (as described in the
<a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/">intro</a>). This strategy is used in the following sample, a
demonstration of background music gradually ramping up in intensity
based on a theme from Warcraft 2:</p>
<div>
<button id="bg-button">Play/pause</button>
atmospheric
<input id="bg" type="range" value="0" min="0" max="100" style="width: 400px">
boss
</div>

<h3 id="toc-tag">The missing link: Audio tag to Web Audio</h3>

<p>Many game developers today use the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag for their background
music, because it is well suited to streaming content. Now you can bring
content from the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag into a Web Audio context.</p>
<p>This technique can be useful since the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag can work with
streaming content, which lets you immediately play the background music
instead of having to wait for it all to download. By bringing the stream
into the Web Audio API, you can manipulate or analyze the stream. The
following example applies a low pass filter to the music played through
the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>var audioElement = document.querySelector('audio');
var mediaSourceNode = context.createMediaElementSource(audioElement);
// Create the filter
var filter = context.createBiquadFilter();
// Create the audio graph.
mediaSourceNode.connect(filter);
filter.connect(context.destination);
</code></pre>
<p>For a more complete discussion about integrating the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag with the
Web Audio API, see this <a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/02/HTML5-audio-and-the-Web-Audio-API-are-BFFs">short article</a>.</p>
<h2 id="toc-sfx">Sound effects</h2>

<p>Games often play back sound effects in response to user input or changes
in game state. Like background music, however, sound effects can get
annoying very quickly. To avoid this, it's often useful to have a pool
of similar but different sounds to play. This can vary from mild
variations of footstep samples, to drastic variations, as seen in the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXgr6SYYNZM">Warcraft series</a> in response to clicking on units.</p>
<p>Another key feature of sound effects in games is that there can be many
of them simultaneously. Imagine you're in the middle of a gunfight with
multiple actors shooting machine guns. Each machine gun fires many times
per second, causing tens of sound effects to be played at the same time.
Playing back sound from multiple, precisely timed sources simultaneously
is one place the Web Audio API really shines.</p>
<p>The following example creates a machine gun round from multiple
individual bullet samples by creating multiple sound sources whose
playback is staggered in time.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>var time = context.currentTime;
for (var i = 0; i &lt; rounds; i++) {
  var source = this.makeSource(this.buffers[M4A1]);
  source.noteOn(time + i * interval);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here's this code in action:</p>
<p><button onclick="mgun.shootRound(0, 3, 0.1);">Short burst M4A1</button>
<button onclick="mgun.shootRound(1, 3, 0.1);">Short burst M1 Garand</button><br/>
<button onclick="mgun.shootRound(0, 10, 0.05);">Long burst M4A1</button><br/></p>
<p>Sorry if that was a little loud! We'll talk about metering and
dynamics compression in a later section.</p>
<p>Now, if all of the machine guns in your game sounded exactly like this,
that would be pretty boring. Of course they would vary by sound based on
distance from the target and relative position (more on this later), but
even that might not be enough. Luckily the Web Audio API provides a way
to easily tweak the example above in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>With a subtle shift in time between bullets firing</li>
<li>By altering playbackRate of each sample (also changing pitch) to
   better simulate randomness of the real world.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two effects are shown below:</p>
<p><button onclick="mgun.shootRound(0, 10, 0.08, 0.05);">Time-randomized M4A1</button>
<button onclick="mgun.shootRound(1, 10, 0.08, 0, 1);">Pitch-randomized Garand</button></p>
<p><a href="samples/machine-gun/gun.js">full source code</a></p>
<p>For a more real-life example of these techniques in action, take a look
at the <a href="http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/o3d-webgl-samples/pool.html">Pool Table demo</a>, which uses random sampling and varies
playbackRate for a more interesting ball collision sound.</p>
<h2 id="toc-3d">3D positional sound</h2>

<p>Games are often set in a world with some geometric properties, either in
2D or in 3D. If this is the case, stereo positioned audio can greatly
increase the immersiveness of the experience. Luckily, Web Audio API
comes with built-in hardware accelerated positional audio features that
are quite straight forward to use. By the way, you should make sure that
you've got stereo speakers (preferably headphones) for the following
example to make sense. In the following sample, you can change the angle
of the source by scrolling while the mouse is over the canvas.</p>
<p><span id="position-sample" style="border: 1px solid black; display: inline-block;">
</span></p>
<p><a href="samples/position/position.js">full source code</a></p>
<p>In the above example, there is a listener (person icon) in the middle of
the canvas, and the mouse affects the position of the source (speaker
icon). The above is a simple example of using <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html#AudioPannerNode-section">AudioPannerNode</a> to
achieve this sort of effect. The basic idea of the sample above is to
respond to mouse movement by setting the position of the audio source,
as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>PositionSample.prototype.changePosition = function(position) {
  // Position coordinates are in normalized canvas coordinates
  // with -0.5 &lt; x, y &lt; 0.5
  if (position) {
    if (!this.isPlaying) {
      this.play();
    }
    var mul = 2;
    var x = position.x / this.size.width;
    var y = -position.y / this.size.height;
    this.panner.setPosition(x * mul, y * mul, -0.5);
  } else {
    this.stop();
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>Things to know about Web Audio's treatment of spatialization:</p>
<ul>
<li>The listener is at the origin (0, 0, 0) by default.</li>
<li>Web Audio positional APIs are unitless, so I introduced a multiplier
  to make the demo sound better.</li>
<li>Web Audio uses the y-is-up cartesian coordinates (the opposite of most
  computer graphics systems). That's why I'm swapping the y-axis in the
  snippet above</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="toc-3d-adv">Advanced: sound cones</h3>

<p>The positional model is very powerful and quite advanced, largely based
on <a href="http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Documentation/OpenAL%201.1%20Specification.pdf">OpenAL</a>. For more details, see sections 3 and 4 of the
above-linked spec.</p>
<p><img alt="position-model" src="res/position-model.png" /></p>
<p>There is a single <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html#AudioListener-section">AudioListener</a> attached to the Web Audio API
context which can be configured in space through position and
orientation. Each source can be passed through an AudioPannerNode, which
spatializes the input audio. The panner node has position and
orientation, as well as a distance and directional model.</p>
<p>The distance model specifies the amount of gain depending on proximity
to the source, while the directional model can be configured by
specifying  an inner and outer cone, which determine amount of (usually
negative) gain if the listener is within the inner cone, between the
inner and outer cone, or outside the outer cone. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>var panner = context.createPanner();
panner.coneOuterGain = 0.5;
panner.coneOuterAngle = 180;
panner.coneInnerAngle = 0;
</code></pre>
<p>Though my example is in 2D, this model generalizes easily to the third
dimension. For an example of sound spatialized in 3D, see this
<a href="http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/simple.html">positional sample</a>. In addition to position, the Web Audio
sound model also optionally includes velocity for doppler shifts. This
example shows the <a href="http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/doppler.html">doppler effect</a> in more detail.</p>
<p>For more information on this topic, read this detailed tutorial on
<a href="/tutorials/webaudio/positional_audio/">mixing positional audio and WebGL</a>.</p>
<h2 id="toc-room">Room effects and filters</h2>

<p>In reality, the way sound is perceived greatly depends on the room in
which that sound is heard. The same creaky door will sound very
different in a basement, compared to an large open hall. Games with high
production value will want to imitate these effects, since creating a
separate set of samples for each environment is prohibitively expensive,
and would lead to even more assets, and a larger amount of game data.</p>
<p>Loosely speaking, the audio term for the difference between the raw
sound and the way it sounds in reality is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response">impulse
response</a>. These impulse responses can be painstakingly
recorded, and in fact there are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=impulse+responses">sites that host</a> many of
these pre-recorded impulse response files (stored as audio) for your
convenience.</p>
<p>For a lot more information about how impulse responses can be created
from a given environment, read through the "Recording Setup" section in
the <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html#Convolution-section">Convolution</a> part of the Web Audio API spec.</p>
<p>More importantly for our purposes, the Web Audio API provides an easy
way to apply these impulse responses to our sounds using the
<a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html#ConvolverNode-section">ConvolverNode</a>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>// Make a source node for the sample.
var source = context.createBufferSource();
source.buffer = this.buffer;
// Make a convolver node for the impulse response.
var convolver = context.createConvolver();
convolver.buffer = this.impulseResponseBuffer;
// Connect the graph.
source.connect(convolver);
convolver.connect(context.destination);
</code></pre>
<p>The following example plays a military speech with a number of different
impulse responses:</p>
<p><button onclick="room.playPause();">Play/pause</button>
<input type="radio" name="ir" value="0" class="effect" checked>Telephone</input>
<input type="radio" name="ir" value="1" class="effect">Muffler</input>
<input type="radio" name="ir" value="2" class="effect">Spring feedback</input>
<input type="radio" name="ir" value="3" class="effect">Crazy echo</input></p>
<p><a href="samples/room-effects/room-effects.js">full source code</a></p>
<p>Also see this <a href="http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/convolution-effects.html">demo of room effects</a> on the Web Audio API spec
page, as well as <a href="http://kevincennis.com/audio/">this example</a> which gives you control over dry
(raw) and wet (processed via convolver) mixing of a great Jazz standard.</p>
<h2 id="toc-final">The final countdown</h2>

<p>So you've built a game, configured your positional audio, and now you
have a large number of AudioNodes in your graph, all playing back
simultaneously. Great, but there's still one more thing to consider:</p>
<p>Since multiple sounds just stack on top of one another with no
normalization, you may find yourself in a situation where you are
exceeding the threshold of your speaker's capability. Like images
exceeding past their canvas boundaries, sounds can also clip if the
waveform exceeds its maximum threshold, producing a distinct distortion.
The waveform looks something like this:</p>
<img src="res/clipping.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;"/>

<p>Here's a real example of clipping in action. The waveform looks bad:</p>
<img src="res/clipping2.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;"/>

<p>And sounds bad:</p>
<p><audio controls loop>
<source src="res/clipping.mp3">
</audio></p>
<p>It's important to listen to harsh distortions like the one above, or
conversely, overly subdued mixes that force your listeners to crank up
the volume. If you're in this situation, you really need to fix it!</p>
<h3 id="toc-clip-detect">Detect clipping</h3>

<p>From a technical perspective, clipping happens when the value of the
signal in any channel exceeds the valid range, namely between -1 and 1.
Once this is detected, it's useful to give visual feedback that this is
happening. To do this reliably, put a <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html#JavaScriptAudioNode-section">JavaScriptAudioNode</a> into
your graph. The audio graph would be setup as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>// Assume entire sound output is being piped through the mix node.
var meter = context.createScriptProcessor(2048, 1, 1);
meter.onaudioprocess = processAudio;
mix.connect(meter);
meter.connect(context.destination);
</code></pre>
<p>And clipping could be detected in the following <code>processAudio</code> handler:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>function processAudio(e) {
  var buffer = e.inputBuffer.getChannelData(0);

  var isClipping = false;
  // Iterate through buffer to check if any of the |values| exceeds 1.
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; buffer.length; i++) {
    var absValue = Math.abs(buffer[i]);
    if (absValue &gt;= 1) {
      isClipping = true;
      break;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In general, be careful not to overuse the <code>JavaScriptAudioNode</code> for
performance reasons. In this case, an alternative implementation of
metering could poll a <code>RealtimeAnalyserNode</code> in the audio graph for
<code>getByteFrequencyData</code>, at render time, as determined by
<code>requestAnimationFrame</code>. This approach is more efficient, but misses
most of the signal (including places where it potentially clips), since
rendering happens at most at 60 times a second, whereas the audio signal
changes far more quickly.</p>
<p>Because clip detection is so important, it's likely that we will see a
built-in <code>MeterNode</code> Web Audio API node in the future.</p>
<h3 id="toc-clip-prevent">Prevent clipping</h3>

<p>By adjusting the gain on the master AudioGainNode, you can subdue your
mix to a level that prevents clipping. However, in practice, since the
sounds playing in your game may depend on a huge variety of factors, it
can be difficult to decide on the master gain value that prevents
clipping for all states. In general, you should tweak gains to
anticipate the worst case, but this is more of an art than a science.</p>
<p>To get a sense of how this works in practice, below is a sample where
you can adjust master gain. If you set the gain too high, the sound will
clip. The monitor will turn red to give a visual indicator of clipping.
The soundscape below is a <a href="http://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00883/">remix</a> of a great Chrono Trigger
track written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasunori_Mitsuda">Yasunori Mitsuda</a> and remixed by Disco
Dan.</p>
<style>
  #meter {width: 36px; height: 36px; display: inline-block; border: 1px solid black;}
  .clip {background: #FF6600;}
  .noclip {background: #00FF66;}
</style>

<p><button onclick="meter.playPause()">Play/pause</button>
Master gain: <input type="range" min="0" step="0.1" max="10" onchange="meter.gainRangeChanged(this)">
Meter level: <span id="meter"></span></p>
<p><a href="samples/metering/metering.js">full source code</a></p>
<h3 id="toc-sweet">Add a bit of sugar</h3>

<p>Compressors are commonly used in music and game production to smooth
over the signal and control spikes in the overall signal. This
functionality is available in the Web Audio world via the
<code>DynamicsCompressorNode</code>, which can be inserted in your audio graph to
give a louder, richer and fuller sound, and also help with clipping.
Directly quoting the spec, this node</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...lowers the volume of the loudest parts of the signal and raises the
volume of the softest parts... It is especially important in games and
musical applications where large numbers of individual sounds are
played simultaneous to control the overall signal level and help avoid
clipping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using dynamics compression is generally a good idea, especially in a
game setting, where, as previously discussed, you don't know exactly
what sounds will play and when. <a href="http://labs.dinahmoe.com/plink">Plink</a> from DinahMoe labs is a
great example of this, since the sounds that are played back completely
depends on you and other participants. A compressor is useful in most
cases, except some rare ones, where you're dealing with painstakingly
mastered tracks that have been tuned to sound "just right" already.</p>
<p>Implementing this is simply a matter of including a
DynamicsCompressorNode in your audio graph, generally as the last node
before the destination.:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"><code>// Assume the output is all going through the mix node.
var compressor = context.createDynamicsCompressor();
mix.connect(compressor);
compressor.connect(context.destination);
</code></pre>
<p>For more detail about dynamics compression, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression">this Wikipedia
article</a> is very informative.</p>
<p>To summarize, listen carefully for clipping and prevent it by inserting
a master gain node. Then tightening the whole mix by using a dynamics
compressor node. Your audio graph might look something like this:</p>

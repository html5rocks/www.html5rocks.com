Before the HTML5 `<audio>` element, Flash or another plugin was required
to break the silence of the web. While audio on the web no longer
requires a plugin, the audio tag brings significant limitations for
implementing sophisticated games and interactive applications.

The Web Audio API is a high-level JavaScript API for processing and
synthesizing audio in web applications. The goal of this API is to
include capabilities found in modern game audio engines and some of the
mixing, processing, and filtering tasks that are found in modern desktop
audio production applications. What follows is a gentle introduction to
using this powerful API.

<h2 id="toc-context">Getting started with the AudioContext</h2>

An [AudioContext][] is for managing and playing all sounds. To produce
a sound using the Web Audio API, create one or more sound sources
and connect them to the sound destination provided by the `AudioContext`
instance. This connection doesn't need to be direct, and can go through
any number of intermediate [AudioNodes][] which act as processing
modules for the audio signal. This [routing][] is described in greater
detail at the Web Audio [specification][spec].

A single instance of `AudioContext` can support multiple sound inputs
and complex audio graphs, so we will only need one of these for each
audio application we create.

The following snippet creates an `AudioContext`:

    var context;
    window.addEventListener('load', init, false);
    function init() {
      try {
        context = new AudioContext();
      }
      catch(e) {
        alert('Web Audio API is not supported in this browser');
      }
    }

For older WebKit-based browsers, use the `webkit` prefix, as with
`webkitAudioContext`.

Many of the interesting Web Audio API functionality such as creating
AudioNodes and decoding audio file data are methods of `AudioContext`.

<h2 id="toc-load">Loading sounds</h2>

The Web Audio API uses an AudioBuffer for short- to medium-length
sounds.  The basic approach is to use [XMLHttpRequest][xhr] for
fetching sound files.

The API supports loading audio file data in multiple formats, such as
WAV, MP3, AAC, OGG and [others][formats]. Browser support for different
audio formats [varies][formats2].

The following snippet demonstrates loading a sound sample:

    var dogBarkingBuffer = null;
    var context = new AudioContext();

    function loadDogSound(url) {
      var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
      request.open('GET', url, true);
      request.responseType = 'arraybuffer';

      // Decode asynchronously
      request.onload = function() {
        context.decodeAudioData(request.response, function(buffer) {
          dogBarkingBuffer = buffer;
        }, onError);
      }
      request.send();
    }

The audio file data is binary (not text), so we set the `responseType`
of the request to `'arraybuffer'`. For more information about
`ArrayBuffers`, see this [article about XHR2][xhr2].

Once the (undecoded) audio file data has been received, it can be kept
around for later decoding, or it can be decoded right away using the
AudioContext `decodeAudioData()` method. This method takes the
`ArrayBuffer` of audio file data stored in `request.response` and
decodes it asynchronously (not blocking the main JavaScript execution
thread).

When `decodeAudioData()` is finished, it calls a callback function which
provides the decoded PCM audio data as an `AudioBuffer`.

<h2 id="toc-play">Playing sounds</h2>

<figure>
<img src="diagrams/simple.png"/>
<figcaption>A simple audio graph</figcaption>
</figure>

Once one or more `AudioBuffers` are loaded, then we're ready to play
sounds. Let's assume we've just loaded an `AudioBuffer` with the sound
of a dog barking and that the loading has finished. Then we can play
this buffer with a the following code.

    var context = new AudioContext();

    function playSound(buffer) {
      var source = context.createBufferSource(); // creates a sound source
      source.buffer = buffer;                    // tell the source which sound to play
      source.connect(context.destination);       // connect the source to the context's destination (the speakers)
      source.noteOn(0);                          // play the source now
    }

This `playSound()` function could be called every time somebody presses a key or
clicks something with the mouse.

The `noteOn(time)` function makes it easy to schedule precise sound
playback for games and other time-critical applications. However, to get
this scheduling working properly, ensure that your sound buffers are
pre-loaded.

<h2 id="toc-abstract">Abstracting the Web Audio API</h2>

Of course, it would be better to create a more general loading system
which isn't hard-coded to loading this specific sound. There are many
approaches for dealing with the many short- to medium-length sounds that
an audio application or game would useâ€“here's one way using a
[BufferLoader class][BufferLoader].

The following is an example of how you can use the `BufferLoader` class.
Let's create two `AudioBuffers`; and, as soon as they are loaded,
let's play them back at the same time.

    window.onload = init;
    var context;
    var bufferLoader;

    function init() {
      context = new AudioContext();

      bufferLoader = new BufferLoader(
        context,
        [
          '../sounds/hyper-reality/br-jam-loop.wav',
          '../sounds/hyper-reality/laughter.wav',
        ],
        finishedLoading
        );

      bufferLoader.load();
    }

    function finishedLoading(bufferList) {
      // Create two sources and play them both together.
      var source1 = context.createBufferSource();
      var source2 = context.createBufferSource();
      source1.buffer = bufferList[0];
      source2.buffer = bufferList[1];

      source1.connect(context.destination);
      source2.connect(context.destination);
      source1.noteOn(0);
      source2.noteOn(0);
    }

<h2 id="toc-abstract">Dealing with time: playing sounds with rhythm</h2>

The Web Audio API lets developers precisely schedule playback. To
demonstrate this, let's set up a simple rhythm track. Probably the
most widely known drumkit pattern is the following:

<figure>
<img src="diagrams/drum.png"/>
<figcaption>A simple rock drum pattern</figcaption>
</figure>

in which a hihat is played every eighth note, and kick and snare are
played alternating every quarter, in 4/4 time.

Supposing we have loaded the `kick`, `snare` and `hihat` buffers, the
code to do this is simple:

    for (var bar = 0; bar < 2; bar++) {
      var time = startTime + bar * 8 * eighthNoteTime;
      // Play the bass (kick) drum on beats 1, 5
      playSound(kick, time);
      playSound(kick, time + 4 * eighthNoteTime);

      // Play the snare drum on beats 3, 7
      playSound(snare, time + 2 * eighthNoteTime);
      playSound(snare, time + 6 * eighthNoteTime);

      // Play the hi-hat every eighth note.
      for (var i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
        playSound(hihat, time + i * eighthNoteTime);
      }
    }

Here, we make only one repeat instead of the unlimited loop we see in
the sheet music. The function `playSound` is a method that plays a
buffer at a specified time, as follows:

    function playSound(buffer, time) {
      var source = context.createBufferSource();
      source.buffer = buffer;
      source.connect(context.destination);
      source.noteOn(time);
    }


<input type="button" onclick="RhythmSample.play();" value="Play"/>

<h2 id="toc-volume">Changing the volume of a sound</h2>

One of the most basic operations you might want to do to a sound is
change its volume. Using the Web Audio API, we can route our source to
its destination through an [AudioGainNode][] in order to manipulate the
volume:

<figure>
<img src="diagrams/gain.png"/>
<figcaption>Audio graph with a gain node</figcaption>
</figure>

This connection setup can be achieved as follows:

    // Create a gain node.
    var gainNode = context.createGainNode();
    // Connect the source to the gain node.
    source.connect(gainNode);
    // Connect the gain node to the destination.
    gainNode.connect(context.destination);

After the graph has been set up, you can programmatically change the
volume by manipulating the `gainNode.gain.value` as follows:

    // Reduce the volume.
    gainNode.gain.value = 0.5;

The following is a demo of a volume control implemented with an `<input
type="range">` element:

<input type="button" onclick="VolumeSample.toggle();" value="Play/Pause"/>
Volume: <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="100" onchange="VolumeSample.changeVolume(this);" />

[full source code](js/volume-sample.js)

<h2 id="toc-xfade">Cross-fading between two sounds</h2>

Now, suppose we have a slightly more complex scenario, where we're
playing multiple sounds but want to cross fade between them. This is a
common case in a DJ-like application, where we have two turntables and
want to be able to pan from one sound source to another.

This can be done with the following audio graph:

<figure>
<img src="diagrams/crossfade.png"/>
<figcaption>Audio graph with two sources connected through gain nodes</figcaption>
</figure>

To set this up, we simply create two [AudioGainNodes][AudioGainNode], and connect
each source through the nodes, using something like this function:

    function createSource(buffer) {
      var source = context.createBufferSource();
      // Create a gain node.
      var gainNode = context.createGainNode();
      source.buffer = buffer;
      // Turn on looping.
      source.loop = true;
      // Connect source to gain.
      source.connect(gainNode);
      // Connect gain to destination.
      gainNode.connect(context.destination);

      return {
        source: source,
        gainNode: gainNode
      };
    }

<h3 id="toc-xfade-ep">Equal power crossfading</h3>

A naive linear crossfade approach exhibits a volume dip as you pan
between the samples.

<figure>
<img src="diagrams/linear-fade.png"/>
<figcaption>A linear crossfade</figcaption>
</figure>

To address this issue, we use an equal power curve, in which the
corresponding gain curves are non-linear, and intersect at a higher
amplitude. This minimizes volume dips between audio regions, resulting
in a more even crossfade between regions that might be slightly
different in level.

<figure>
<img src="diagrams/equal-fade.png"/>
<figcaption>An equal power crossfade</figcaption>
</figure>

The following demo uses an `<input type="range">` control to crossfade
between the two sound sources:

<input type="button" onclick="CrossfadeSample.toggle();" value="Play/Pause"/>
Drums <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="100" onchange="CrossfadeSample.crossfade(this);" /> Organ

[full source code](js/crossfade-sample.js)

<h3 id="toc-xfade-play">Playlist crossfading</h3>

Another common crossfader application is for a music player application.
When a song changes, we want to fade the current track out, and fade the
new one in, to avoid a jarring transition. To do this, schedule a
crossfade into the future. While we could use `setTimeout` to do this
scheduling, this is [not precise][jstimer]. With the Web Audio API, we
can use the [AudioParam][] interface to schedule future values for
parameters such as the gain value of an `AudioGainNode`.

Thus, given a playlist, we can transition between tracks by scheduling a
gain decrease on the currently playing track, and a gain increase on the
next one, both slightly before the current track finishes playing:

    function playHelper(bufferNow, bufferLater) {
      var playNow = createSource(bufferNow);
      var source = playNow.source;
      var gainNode = playNow.gainNode;
      var duration = bufferNow.duration;
      var currTime = context.currentTime;
      // Fade the playNow track in.
      gainNode.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(0, currTime);
      gainNode.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(1, currTime + ctx.FADE_TIME);
      // Play the playNow track.
      source.noteOn(0);
      // At the end of the track, fade it out.
      gainNode.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(1, currTime + duration-ctx.FADE_TIME);
      gainNode.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(0, currTime + duration);
      // Schedule a recursive track change with the tracks swapped.
      var recurse = arguments.callee;
      ctx.timer = setTimeout(function() {
        recurse(bufferLater, bufferNow);
      }, (duration - ctx.FADE_TIME) * 1000);
    }

The Web Audio API provides a convenient set of `RampToValue` methods to
gradually change the value of a parameter, such as
`linearRampToValueAtTime` and `exponentialRampToValueAtTime`.

While the transition timing function can be picked from built-in linear
and exponential ones (as above), you can also specify your own value
curve via an array of values using the `setValueCurveAtTime` function.

The following demo shows an playlist-like auto-crossfade between two
tracks using the above approach:

<input type="button" onclick="CrossfadePlaylistSample.toggle();" value="Play/Pause"/>

<h2 id="toc-filter">Applying a simple filter effect to a sound</h2>

<figure>
<img src="diagrams/filter.png"/>
<figcaption>An audio graph with a <code>BiquadFilterNode</code></figcaption>
</figure>

The Web Audio API lets you pipe sound from one audio node into another,
creating a potentially complex chain of processors to add complex
effects to your soundforms.

One way to do this is to place [BiquadFilterNode][]s between your sound
source and destination. This type of audio node can do a variety of
low-order filters which can be used to build graphic equalizers and even
more complex effects, mostly to do with selecting which parts of the
frequency spectrum of a sound to emphasize and which to subdue.

Supported types of filters include:

* Low pass filter
* High pass filter
* Band pass filter
* Low shelf filter
* High shelf filter
* Peaking filter
* Notch filter
* All pass filter

And all of the filters include parameters to specify some amount of
[gain][], the frequency at which to apply the filter, and a quality factor.
The low-pass filter keeps the lower frequency range, but discards high
frequencies. The break-off point is determined by the frequency value,
and the [Q factor][qfactor] is unitless, and determines the shape of the
graph. The gain only affects certain filters, such as the low-shelf and
peaking filters, and not this low-pass filter.

Let's setup a simple low-pass filter to extract only the bases from a
sound sample:

    // Create the filter
    var filter = context.createBiquadFilter();
    // Create the audio graph.
    source.connect(filter);
    filter.connect(context.destination);
    // Create and specify parameters for the low-pass filter.
    filter.type = 0; // Low-pass filter. See BiquadFilterNode docs
    filter.frequency.value = 440; // Set cutoff to 440 HZ
    // Playback the sound.
    source.noteOn(0);

The following demo uses a similar technique and lets you enable and
disable a lowpass filter via a checkbox, as well as tweak the frequency
and quality values with the slider:

<input type="button" onclick="FilterSample.toggle();" value="Play/Pause"/>
Filter on: <input type="checkbox" checked="false"
    onchange="FilterSample.toggleFilter(this);"/>
Frequency: <input type="range" min="0" max="1" step="0.01" value="1" onchange="FilterSample.changeFrequency(this);" />
Quality: <input type="range" min="0" max="1" step="0.01" value="0" onchange="FilterSample.changeQuality(this);" />

[full source code](js/filter-sample.js)

In general, frequency controls need to be tweaked to work on a
logarithmic scale since human hearing itself works on the same principle
(that is, A4 is 440hz, and A5 is 880hz). For more details, see the
`FilterSample.changeFrequency` function in the source code link above.

Lastly, note that the sample code lets you connect and disconnect the
filter, dynamically changing the AudioContext graph. We can disconnect
AudioNodes from the graph by calling `node.disconnect(outputNumber)`.
For example, to re-route the graph from going through a filter, to a
direct connection, we can do the following:

    // Disconnect the source and filter.
    source.disconnect(0);
    filter.disconnect(0);
    // Connect the source directly.
    source.connect(context.destination);

<h2 id="toc-further">Further listening</h2>

We've covered the basics of the API, including loading and playing audio
samples. We've built audio graphs with gain nodes and filters, and
scheduled sounds and audio parameter tweaks to enable some common sound
effects. At this point, you are ready to go and build some sweet web
audio applications!

If you are seeking inspiration, many developers have already created
[great work][samples] using the Web Audio API. Some of my favorite
include:

* [AudioJedit][jedit], an in-browser sound splicing tool that uses
  SoundCloud permalinks.
* [ToneCraft][tcraft], a sound sequencer where sounds are created by
  stacking 3D blocks.
* [Plink][plink], a collaborative music-making game using Web Audio and Web
  Sockets.

  <a href="http://www.movikantirevo.com" target="_blank">Movi.Kanti.Revo</a> is 
  a new sensory Chrome experiment crafted by Cirque du Soleil and developed by 
  Subatomic Systems that brings the wonder of Cirque du Soleil to the web through 
  modern web technologies.  
</p>

<h2 id="toc-introduction">Building the 3D World</h2>
<p>
  The experiment was created using just HTML5, and the environment is built 
  entirely with markup and CSS.  Like set pieces on 
  stage, <code>div</code>s, <code>img</code>s, small <code>video</code>s and 
  other elements are positioned in a 3D space using CSS.  Using the new 
  <code>getUserMedia</code> API enabled a whole new way of interacting with the 
  experiment, instead of using the keyboard or mouse, a JavaScript facial 
  detection library tracks your head and moves the environment along with you.

  This is the first in a series of articles that covers how this Chrome 
  Experiment was built.  Each one will focus on a different piece of technology 
  and explain how it was used to create this immersive experience.

<h2 id="toc-stage">All the Web's a Stage</h2>

<p>
  To build this experiment, it’s best to imagine the browser as a stage, and the
  elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s, images, videos and other elements as
  set pieces positioned in 3D space using CSS.  Each element, or set piece is
  positioned on the stage by applying a 3D transform.  If you’re unfamiliar with
  the <code>translate3d</code> transform, it takes 3 parameters, X, Y and Z.  X 
  moves the element along a horizontal line, Y moves the element up and down, 
  and Z moves the element closer or further away.  For example, applying a 
  <code>transform: translate3d(100px, -200px, 300px)</code> will move the element 
  100 pixels to the right, 200 pixels down and 300 pixels closer towards the 
  viewer. 
</p>

<h3 id="toc-auditorium">Building the Auditorium</h3>
<p>
  Let’s take a look at the <a href="http://www.movikantirevo.com/#sea,">last 
  scene</a> and to see how it’s put together.  All scenes are broken down into 
  three primary containers, the world container, a perspective container and 
  the stage.  The world container effectively setups up the viewers camera, and 
  uses the CSS <code>perspective</code> property to tell the browser where the 
  viewer will be looking at the element from.  The 
  <code>#perspective-container</code> is used to change our perspective by 
  applying 3D transforms to it.  Finally, the stage contains the actual set 
  pieces that will be visible on screen. 
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;div id="world-container"&gt;
  &lt;div id="perspective-container"&gt;
    &lt;div id="stage"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
#world-container {
  perspective: 700px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

#perspective-container {
  {% mixin transform-style: preserve-3d; %}
  {% mixin transform-origin: center center; %}
  {% mixin perspective-origin: center center; %}
  {% mixin transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0) rotateX(0deg) rotateY(0deg) rotateZ(0deg); %}
}
</pre>

<h3 id="toc-visuzalizing-the-stage">Visualizing the Stage</h3>
<p>
  Within the stage, there are seven elements in the final scene.  Moving from 
  back to front, they include the sky background, a fog layer, the doors, the 
  water, reflections, an additional fog layer, and finally the cliffs in front.   
  Each item is placed on stage with a 
  <code>transform: translate3d(x, y, z)</code> CSS property that indicates where 
  it fits in 3D space. We used the z value in a similar way that we’d use 
  <code>z-index</code>, but with the <code>translate3d</code> property, we can 
  also provide a unit with the value.

  Figure 1 shows the scene zoomed out and rotated almost 90 degrees so that you
  can visualize the way each of the different set pieces are placed within the
  stage.  At the back (furthest to the left), you can see the background, fog,
  doors, water and finally the cliffs.
</p>

<h3 id="toc-stage-background">Placing the Background on Stage</h3>
<p>
  Let’s start with the background image.  Since it’s the furthest back, we 
  applied a -990px transform on the Z-axis to push it back in our perspective
  (see Figure 2).
</p>

<p>
  <figure>
    <a href="/static/demos/movikantirevo/build1.html">
      <img alt="Figure 2: The stage, with only the background placed at -990px"

    <figcaption>

    </a>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
  As it moves back in space, physics demands that it gets smaller, so it needs 
  to be resized via a <code>scale(3.3)</code> property to fit the viewport and 
  aligned the top edge with the top of the viewport with a 
  <code>translate3d</code> on the y-axis (see Figure 3).
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
.background {
  width: 1280px;
  height: 800px;
  top: 0px;
  background-image: url(stars.png);
  {% mixin transform: translate3d(0, 786px, <b>-990px</b>) <b>scale(3.3)</b>; %}
}
</pre>

  The <a href="fog_blue.png">fog</a>, <a href="door2.png">doors</a>, and the 
  <a href="cliff.png">cliffs</a> in the same way, each by applying a 
  <code>translate3d</code> with an appropriate z position and scale factor 
  (see Figure 4).  Notice how the fog is stacked behind the doors, and behind 
  the cliffs.

<h3 id="toc-stage-horizonal">Adding the Sea</h3>
<p>
  To create as realistic an environment as possible, we knew we couldn’t simply 
  put the water on a vertical plane, it’s typically doesn’t exist that way in 
  the real world.  In addition to applying the <code>translate3d</code> to 
  position the water on stage, we also apply an x-axis (horizontal) rotation of 
  60 degrees (<code>rotateX(60deg)</code>) to make it appear flat and textured.  
  A similar rotation was added to the door reflection and secondary fog to make 
  it appear in the correct plane (see Figure 5).
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
.sea {
  bottom: 120px;
  background-image: url(sea2.png);
  width: 1280px;
  height: 283px;
  {% mixin transform: translate3d(-100px, 225px, -30px) scale(2.3) <b>rotateX(60deg)</b>; %}
}
</pre>

    </a>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
  Each scene was built in a similar fashion, elements were visualized within the 
  3D space of a stage, and an appropriate transform was applied to each.

<h2>Changing Perspective</h2>
<p>
  In the next article, we’re going to cover perspective in more depth, but to 
  whet your appetite, open <a href="/static/demos/movikantirevo/build4.html">Figure 5</a>, and use the 
  Chrome Developer Tools to try playing with the <code>transform3d</code> and 
  <code>rotateX</code>, <code>rotateY</code> and <code>rotateZ</code> properties 
  on the <code>#perspective-container</code>.  Try changing each of the values 
  independently and see how they change the view.

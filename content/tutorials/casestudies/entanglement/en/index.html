  <h2 id="toc-introduction">Introduction</h2>
 
  <p>This past spring (2010) I took interest in the rapidly increasing support
    for HTML5 and related technologies. At the time, a friend and I had been
    challenging each other in two-week game development competitions to hone
    our programming and development skills as well as bring to life the game
    ideas we were constantly tossing at each other. So, I naturally began
    incorporating HTML5 elements into my competition entries to gain a better
    understanding for how they worked and be able to do things that were nearly
    impossible using earlier HTML specs.</p>

  <p>Of the many new features in HTML5, the increasing support for the canvas
    tag offered me an exciting opportunity to implement interactive art using
    JavaScript, which led me to try implementing a puzzle game now called
    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aciahcmjmecflokailenpkdchphgkefd">Entanglement</a>.
    I had already created a prototype using the back of Settlers
    of Catan tiles, so using this as a blueprint of sorts, there are three
    essential parts to fashioning the hexagonal tile on the HTML5 canvas for
    web play: drawing the hexagon, drawing the paths, and rotating the tile.
    The following goes into detail outlining how I accomplished each of these
    in their current form.</p>

  <h2 id="toc-hexagon">Drawing the Hexagon</h2>

  <p>In the original version of Entanglement, I used several canvas draw methods
    to draw the hexagon, but the current form of the game uses drawImage() to
    draw textures clipped from a sprite sheet.</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/casestudies/gopherwood/tiles.png" style="max-width: 100%" title="Tiles sprite sheet" alt="Tiles sprite sheet" />
    <figcaption>Tiles sprite sheet</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>I combined the images together into a single file so it's only one request
    to the server instead of, in this case, ten. To draw a chosen hexagon to the
    canvas, we first must gather our tools together: canvas, context, and the image.</p>

  <p>To create a canvas, all we need is the canvas tag in our html document like so:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;canvas id="myCanvas"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

  <p>I give it an id so we can pull it into our script:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
var cvs = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
</pre>

  <p>Secondly, we need to grab the 2d context for the canvas so we can begin drawing:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
var ctx = cvs.getContext('2d');
</pre>

  <p>Lastly, we need the image. If it's named "tiles.png" in the same folder as
    our web page, we can get it by:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
var img = new Image();
img.src = 'tiles.png';
</pre>

  <p>Now that we have the three components, we can use ctx.drawImage() to draw
    the single hexagon we want from the sprite sheet to the canvas:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
ctx.drawImage(img, sourceX, sourceY, sourceWidth, sourceHeight,
              destinationX, destinationY, destinationWidth, destinationHeight);
</pre>

  <p>In this case, we're using the fourth hexagon from the left on the top row.
    Also, we will draw it to the canvas in the top left corner, keeping it the
    same size as the original. Assuming the hexagons are 400 pixels wide and
    346 pixels high, altogether it will look something like this:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
var cvs = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
var ctx = cvs.getContext('2d');
var img = new Image();
img.src = 'tiles.png';
var sourceX = 1200;
var sourceY = 0;
var sourceWidth = 400;
var sourceHeight = 346;
var destinationX = 0;
var destinationY = 0;
var destinationWidth = 400;
var destinationHeight = 346;
ctx.drawImage(img, sourceX, sourceY, sourceWidth, sourceHeight,
              destinationX, destinationY, destinationWidth, destinationHeight);
</pre>

  <p>We have successfully copied part of the image to the canvas with this as the result:</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/casestudies/gopherwood/hexagon.png" style="max-width: 100%" title="Hexagonal tile" alt="Hexagonal tile" />
    <figcaption>Hexagonal tile</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2 id="toc-paths">Drawing Paths</h2>

  <p>Now that we have our hexagon drawn to the canvas, we want to draw a few lines
    on it. First, we will look at some geometry regarding the hexagon tile. We want
    two line ends per side with each ending 1/4 from the ends along the each edge and
    1/2 of the edge apart from one another, like so:</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/casestudies/gopherwood/endpoints.png" style="max-width: 100%" title="Line endpoints on hexagonal tile" alt="Line endpoints on hexagonal tile" />
    <figcaption>Line endpoints on hexagonal tile</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>We also want a nice curve, so, using a little trial and error, I found that,
    if I make a perpendicular line from the edge at each endpoint, the intersection
    from each pair of endpoints around a given angle of the hexagon makes a nice
    bezier control point for the given endpoints:</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/casestudies/gopherwood/control-points.png" style="max-width: 100%" title="Control points on hexagonal tile" alt="Control points on hexagonal tile" />
    <figcaption>Control points on hexagonal tile</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Now, we map both the endpoints and the control points to a Cartesian plane
    corresponding with our canvas image and we're ready to get back to the code.
    To keep it simple, we will start with one line. We will begin by drawing a path
    from the top left endpoint to the bottom right endpoint. With our earlier hexagon
    image being 400x346, that will make our top endpoint 150 pixels across and 0 pixels
    down, shorthand (150, 0). It's control point will be (150, 86). The bottom edge
    endpoint is (250, 346) with a control point of (250, 260):</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/casestudies/gopherwood/coordinates.png" style="max-width: 100%" title="Coordinates for first bezier curve" alt="Coordinates for first bezier curve" />
    <figcaption>Coordinates for first bezier curve</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>With our coordinates in hand, we are now prepared to begin drawing. We will
    start fresh with ctx.beginPath() and then move to the first endpoint using:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
ctx.moveTo(pointX1,pointY1);
</pre>

  <p>We can then draw the line itself using ctx.bezierCurveTo() as follows:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
ctx.bezierCurveTo(controlX1, controlY1, controlX2, controlY2, pointX2, pointY2);
</pre>

  <p>Since we want the line to have a nice border, we will stroke this path twice
    using a different width and color each time. Color will be set using the
    ctx.strokeStyle property and width will be set using ctx.lineWidth. Altogether,
    drawing the first line will look like this:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
var pointX1 = 150;
var pointY1 = 0;
var controlX1 = 150;
var controlY1 = 86;
var controlX2 = 250;
var controlY2 = 260;
var pointX2 = 250;
var pointY2 = 346;
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(pointX1, pointY1);
ctx.bezierCurveTo(controlX1, controlY1, controlX2, controlY2, pointX2, pointY2);
ctx.lineWidth = 15;
ctx.strokeStyle = '#ffffff';
ctx.stroke();
ctx.lineWidth = 10;
ctx.strokeStyle = '#786c44';
ctx.stroke();
</pre>

  <p>We now have a hexagonal tile with the first line meandering across:</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/casestudies/gopherwood/single-line.png" style="max-width: 100%" title="Solitary line on hexagonal tile" alt="Solitary line on hexagonal tile" />
    <figcaption>Solitary line on hexagonal tile</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Entering coordinates for the other 10 endpoints as well as the corresponding
    bezier curve control points, we can repeat the steps above and might create a
    tile something like this:</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/casestudies/gopherwood/completed-tile.png" style="max-width: 100%" title="Completed hexagonal tile" alt="Completed hexagonal tile" />
    <figcaption>Completed hexagonal tile</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3 id="toc-rotating">Rotating the Canvas</h3>

  <p>Once we have our tile, we want to be able to turn it so different paths can
    be taken in the game. To accomplish this using canvas, we use ctx.translate()
    and ctx.rotate(). We want the tile to rotate about it's center, so our first
    step is to move the canvas reference point to the center of the hexagonal tile.
    To do this we use:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
ctx.translate(originX, originY);
</pre>

  <p>Where originX will be half of the hexagonal tile's width and originY will be
  half of the height, giving us:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
var originX = 200;
var originY = 173;
ctx.translate(originX, originY);
</pre>

  <p>Now we are able to rotate the tile with our new center point. Since a hexagon
  has six sides, we will want to rotate it by some multiple of Math.PI divided by 3.
  We will keep it simple and go with a single turn clockwise using:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
ctx.rotate(Math.PI / 3);
</pre>

  <p>However, since our hexagon and lines are using the old (0,0) coordinates as
  the origin, once we are finished rotating, we will want to translate back before
  drawing. So, altogether we now have:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
var originX = 200;
var originY = 173;
ctx.translate(originX, originY);
ctx.rotate(Math.PI / 3);
ctx.translate(-originX, -originY);
</pre>

  <p>Putting the above translation and rotation before our rendering code causes
  it to now render the rotated tile:</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/casestudies/gopherwood/rotated-tile.png" style="max-width: 100%" title="Rotated hexagonal tile" alt="Rotated hexagonal tile" />
    <figcaption>Rotated hexagonal tile</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2 id="toc-summary">Summary</h2>

  <p>Above I have highlighted a few of the capabilities that HTML5 has to offer
  using the canvas tag, including rendering images, drawing bezier curves, and
  rotating the canvas. Using the HTML5 canvas tag and its JavaScript drawing tools
  for Entanglement proved to be an enjoyable experience, and I look forward to
  the many new applications and games that others create with this open and
  emerging technology.</p>

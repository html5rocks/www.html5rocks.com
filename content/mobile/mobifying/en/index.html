<h2 id="toc-introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Developing for the mobile web is a hot topic these days. This year, for the
first time ever, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jbHjxzXq6y9RhP8LBGniMEAzeFSw?docId=8003d946cb934722b3f814c5909bbdc4">smart phones out sold PCs</a>.
More and more users are using a mobile device to traverse the web, which means it's
becoming critical for developers to optimize their sites for the mobile browsers.</p>

<p>The "mobile" battlefield is still uncharted waters for a large number of developers.
Many folks have existing legacy sites that neglect mobile users altogether.
Instead, the site was designed primarily for desktop browsing and degrades poorly
in mobile browsers. This site (html5rocks.com) is no exception. At launch, we
put little effort into a mobile version of the site.</p>

<h2 id="toc-goals">Creating a mobile-friendly html5rocks.com</h2>

<p>As an exercise I thought it would be interesting to take html5rocks
(an existing HTML5 site) and augment it with a mobile-friendly version.
I was mainly concerned with the minimum amount of work 
required to target smart phones. The goal of my exercise was not to create an
entirely new mobile site and maintain two codebases. That would have taken forever
and have been a huge waste of time. We had already defined the site's structure (markup). We had a look and
feel (CSS). The core functionality (JS) was there. Point is, many sites are
in this same boat.</p>

<p>This article examines how we created a mobile version of html5rocks optimized
for Android and iOS devices. Just load html5rocks.com on a device that supports one of those OSs to see the difference.
There are no redirects to a m.html5rocks.com or other tomfoolery of that nature. You get html5rocks as is...with the added benefit of something that looks great and works well on a mobile device.</p>

<h2 id="toc-mediaqueries">CSS Media Queries</h2>

<p>HTML4 and CSS2 have supported <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/media.html">media-dependent style sheets</a>
for some time. For example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="print" href="printer.css"&gt;
</pre>

<p>would target print devices and provide specific styling for the page content when it is printed.
CSS3 takes the idea of media types one step further and enhances their functionality with media queries.
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">Media queries</a>
extend the usefulness of media types by allowing more precise labeling of style sheets.
This enables the content's presentation to be customized to a specific range
of output devices without having to change the content itself. Sounds perfect for an existing
layout that needs modifying!</p>

<p>You can use media queries in the <code>media</code> attribute of your external
stylesheets to target screen width, device width, orientation, etc. For the full list,
see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">W3C media query specification</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toc-media-screensizes">Targeting screen sizes</h3>

<p>In the following example, <code>phone.css</code> would apply to devices
that the browser considers "handheld" or devices with screens &lt;= 320px wide.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;
  media=&quot;<strong>handheld, only screen and (max-device-width: 320px)</strong>&quot; href=&quot;phone.css&quot;&gt;
</pre>

<p>Prefixing a media queries with the "<code>only</code>" keyword will cause
non CSS3-compliant browsers to ignore the rule.</p>

<p>The following would target screen sizes between 641px and 800px:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;
  media=&quot;<strong>only screen and (min-width: 641px) and (max-width: 800px)</strong>&quot; href=&quot;ipad.css&quot;&gt;
</pre>

<p>Media queries can also appear within inline <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags. The following
targets <code>all</code> media types when in a portrait orientation:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;style&gt;
  @media only all and (orientation: portrait) { ... }
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>

<h3 id="toc-media-handheld">media="handheld"</h3>

<p>We need to stop for a minute and discuss <code>media="handheld"</code>.
Fact is, Android and iOS ignore <code>media="handheld"</code>. The claim is that users will
miss the high end content provided by stylesheets targeting <code>media="screen"</code>
and developers are less likely to maintain a lower quality <code>media="handheld"</code>
version. So, as part of their "full web" motto, most modern smart phone browsers
simply ignore handheld style sheets.</p>

<p>It would be ideal to use this feature to target mobile devices, but various
browsers have implemented it in different ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some read only the handheld style sheet.</li>
  <li>Some read only the handheld style sheet if there is one, but default to the screen style sheet otherwise.</li>
  <li>Some read both the handheld style sheet and the screen style sheet.</li>
  <li>Some read only the screen style sheet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Opera Mini does <strong>not</strong> ignore <code>media="handheld"</code>. The trick to getting
Windows Mobile to recognize <code>media="handheld"</code> is to capitalize the media
attribute value for the screen stylesheet:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;!-- media="handheld" trick for Windows Mobile --&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="screen.css" media="Screen"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="mobile.css" media="handheld"&gt;
</pre>

<h3 id="toc-mediaqueries-h5r">How html5rocks uses media queries</h3>

<p>Media queries are used heavily throughout mobile html5rocks. They allowed us
tweak the layout without having to make significant changes to our Django
template markup...a real lifesaver! In addition,
<a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=media%20queries">their support</a> across
the various browsers is pretty good.</p>

<p>In the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of each page you'll see the following stylesheets:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;
  media=&quot;all&quot; href=&quot;/static/css/base.min.css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;
  media=&quot;only screen and (max-width: 800px)&quot; href=&quot;/static/css/mobile.min.css&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

<p><a href="/static/css/base.css"><code>base.css</code></a> has always defined the main look and feel of
html5rocks.com, but now we're applying new styles (<a href="/static/css/mobile.css"><code>mobile.css</code></a>)
for screen widths under 800px. Its media query covers smart phones (~320px) and the iPad (~768px).
The effect: we're incrementally overriding styles in <code>base.css</code> (only as necessary)
to make things look better in mobile.</p>

<p>Some of the styling changes that <code>mobile.css</code> enforces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reduces extra whitespace/padding across the site. Small screens means space is at a premium!</li>
  <li>Removes <code>:hover</code> states. They'll never been seen on touch devices.</li>
  <li>Adjusts the layout to be single column. <a href="#toc-layout">More on this later</a>.</li>
  <li>Removes the <code>box-shadow</code> around the site's main container div. Large box shadows
  reduce page performance.</li>
  <li>Used CSS flex box model <code>box-ordinal-group</code> to change the ordering of each section on the homepage.
  You'll notice the "LEARN BY MAJOR HTML5 FEATURE GROUPS" comes before the "TUTORIALS" section on the <a href="/">homepage</a>
  but after it on the mobile version. This ordering made more sense for mobile and didn't require markup changes.
  CSS flexbox FTW!</li>
  <li>Removes <code>opacity</code> changes. Changing alpha values is a performance hit on mobile.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc-meta">Mobile meta tags</h2>

<p>Mobile WebKit supports a few goodies that give users a better browsing experience
on certain devices.</p>

<h3 id="toc-meta-viewport">Viewport settings</h3>

The first meta setting (and one that you'll use most often) is the viewport property.
Setting a viewport tells the browser how content should fit on the device's screen
and informs the browser that the site is optimized for mobile. For example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="<strong>width=device-width</strong>, <strong>initial-scale=1.0</strong>, <strong>user-scalable=yes</strong>">
</pre>

<p>tells the browser to set the viewport to the width of the device with an initial
scale of 1. This example also allows zooming, something that may be desirable
for a web site but not a web app. We could prevent zooming with <code>user-scalable=no</code>
or cap the scaling to a certain level:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;meta name=viewport
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.5 maximum-scale=1.0"&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note: <code>width</code> can also take a pixel value. Setting <code>width=320</code> would
achieve the same result as <code>width=device-width</code> on the iPhone and a
few other smart phones. Keep in mind not all phones have this exact width, so it's
best to stick with <code>device-width</code> and let the browser figure out the rest.</p>

<p>Android extends the viewport meta tag by allowing developers to to specify
which screen resolution the site has been developed for:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="<strong>target-densitydpi=device-dpi</strong>"&gt;
</pre>

<p>Possible values for <code>target-densitydpi</code> are <code>device-dpi</code>, <code>high-dpi</code>,
<code>medium-dpi</code>, <code>low-dpi</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to modify your web page for different screen densities, use the
<code>-webkit-device-pixel-ratio</code> CSS media query and/or the <code>window.devicePixelRatio</code>
property in JavaScript, then set the <code>target-densitydpi</code> meta property
to <code>device-dpi</code>. This stops Android from performing scaling in your web
page and allows you to make the necessary adjustments for each density, via CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>See Android's <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html">WebView documentation</a>
for more information on targeting device resolutions.</p>

<h3 id="toc-meta-fullscreen">Full-screen browsing</h3>

<p>There are two other meta values that are iOS-sfic. <code>apple-mobile-web-app-capable</code>
and <code>apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style</code> will render page content
in app-like full screen mode and make the status bar translucent:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"&gt;
&lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent"&gt;
</pre>

<p>For more information on all of the available meta options, see the
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariHTMLRef/Articles/MetaTags.html">Safari reference documentation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="toc-meta-viewport">Home screen icons</h3>

<p>iOS and Android devices also accept a
<code>rel="apple-touch-icon"</code> (iOS) and <code>rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed"</code> (Android)
for links. These create a flashy app-like icon on the user's home screen when they bookmark your site:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon"
      href="/static/images/identity/HTML5_Badge_64.png" /&gt;
&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed"
      href="/static/images/identity/HTML5_Badge_64.png" /&gt;
</pre>

<h3 id="toc-meta-html5rocks">How html5rocks uses mobile meta tags</h3>

<p>Putting everything together, here is a snippet from the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
section of html5rocks:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;head&gt;
  ...
  &lt;meta name="viewport"
        content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0" /&gt;

  &lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon"
        href="/static/images/identity/HTML5_Badge_64.png" /&gt;
  &lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed"
        href="/static/images/identity/HTML5_Badge_64.png" /&gt;
  ...
&lt;/head&gt;
</pre>

<h2 id="toc-layout">Vertical layout</h2>

<p>On smaller screens, it is far more convenient to scroll vertically than horizontally.
Keeping content in a single-column, vertical layout is preferred for mobile.
For html5rocks, we used CSS3 media queries to create such a layout. Again, without
changing markup.</p>

  <figcaption>Single-column vertical layout throughout the site.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="toc-optimizations">Mobile optimizations</h2>

<p>Most of the optimizations that we made are things that should have been
done in the first place. Things like reducing the number of network requests,
JS/CSS compression, gzipping (comes from free on App Engine), and minimizing DOM manipulations. These techniques
are <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/rules_intro.html">common best practices</a>
but are occasionally overlooked when rushing a site out the door.</p>

<h3 id="toc-optimizations-scrolling">Auto-hide address bar</h3>

<p>Mobile browsers lacks the screen real estate of its desktop counterpart.
To make things worst, on different platforms, you sometimes end up with a big ol'
address bar at the top of the screen...even after the page is done loading.</p>

<p>One easy way to deal with it is to scroll the page using JavaScript.
Even doing so by one pixel will take care of the pesky address bar.
To force-hide the address bar on html5rocks, I attached an <code>onload</code>
event handler to the <code>window</code> object and scrolled the page vertically
by one pixel:</p>

<figure>
  <a href="/tutorials/"><img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobifying/address-bar-mobile.png" width="202" height="300" alt="Address bar" title="Address bar"></a>
  <figcaption>Ugly address bar takes up screen real estate.</figcaption>
</figure>

<pre class="prettyprint">
{% if is_mobile % }
  // Hides mobile browser's address bar when page is done loading.
  window.addEventListener('load', function(e) {
    setTimeout(function() { window.scrollTo(0, 1); }, 1);
  }, false);
{% endif % }
</pre>

<p>We also wrapped this listener is our <code>is_mobile</code> template variable
since it's not needed on the desktop.</p>

<h3 id="toc-optimizations-requests">Reduce network requests, save bandwidth</h3>

<p>It's a known fact that reducing the number of HTTP requests
can greatly improve performance. Mobile devices further limit the number of concurrent
connections the browser can make, so mobile sites will benefit even more from
reducing these extraneous requests. Furthermore, shaving off every byte is critical
because bandwidth is often limited on phones. You may be costing users money!</p>

<p>The following are some of the approaches we took to minimize network requests and reduce bandwidth
on html5rocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Remove iframes</strong> - iframes are slow! A large amount of our
    latency came from 3rd party sharing widgets (Buzz, Google Friend Connect, Twitter, Facebook)
    on tutorial pages. These APIs were included via &lt;script&gt; tags and create
    iframes that diminish the speed of the page. The widgets were removed for mobile.</li>
  <li><code><strong>display:none</strong></code> - In certain cases, we were hiding markup if
    it didn't fit the mobile profile. A good example were the four rounded boxes at
    the top of the <a href="/">homepage</a>:
    <figure>
      <img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobifying/box-icons.png" alt="Box buttons on homepage" title="Box buttons on homepage">
      <figcaption>Box buttons on homepage.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>They're missing from the mobile site. It's important to remember that
    the browser still makes a request for each icon, despite their container
    being hidden with <code>display:none</code>. Therefore, it wasn't sufficient to simply
    hide these buttons. Not only would that be wasting bandwidth, but the user wouldn't
    even see the fruits of that wasted bandwidth! The solution was to create a 
    "is_mobile" boolean in our Django template to conditionally omit sections of HTML.
    When the user is viewing the site on a smart device, the buttons are left out.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="#toc-optimizations-appcache">Application Cache</a></strong> -
  Not only does this give us offline support, but it also creates a faster startup.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS/JS compression</strong> - we're using YUI compressor instead
  of <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/">Closure compiler</a> mainly because it
  handles both CSS and JS. One issue that we ran into was that inline media queries
  (media queries that appear inside a stylesheet) barfed in YUI compressor 2.4.2 (see
  <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201012/yui_compressor_and_css_media_queries/">this issue</a>).
  Using YUI Compressor 2.4.4+ fixed the problem.</li>
  <li>Used of CSS image sprites where possible.</li>
  <li>Used pngcrush for image compression.</li>
  <li>Used dataURIs for small images. Base64 encoding adds ~30%+ of size to the image
   but saves the network request.</li>
  <li>Auto loaded Google Custom Search using a single script tag rather than dynamically loading
  it with <code>google.load()</code>. The latter makes an extra request.
<pre class="prettyprint" style="overflow:auto">
&lt;script src="//www.google.com/jsapi?autoload={"modules":[{"name":"search","version":"1"}]}"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Our code pretty printer and <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> were
  being included on every page, even if they were never used. Modernizr is great,
  but it runs a bunch of tests on every load. Some of those tests make costly modifications
  to the DOM and slows down page load. Now, we're only including these libraries
  on pages where they're actually needed. -2 requests :)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional performance tweaks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moved all JS to the bottom of the page (where possible).</li>
  <li>Removed inline &lt;style&gt; tags.</li>
  <li><strong>Cached DOM lookups and minimized DOM manipulations</strong> - Every time
  you touch the DOM the browser performs a
  <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/efficient-javascript/?page=3">reflow</a>. Reflows
  are even more costly on a mobile device.</li>
  <li>Offloaded wasteful client-side code to the server. Specifically, the check
  to see set the navigation styling of the current page:
<pre class="prettyprint">
var lis = document.querySelectorAll('header nav li');
var i = lis.length;
while (i--) {
  var a = lis[i].querySelector('a');
  var section = a.getAttribute("data-section");
  if (new RegExp(section).test(document.location.href)) {
    a.className = 'current';
  }
}
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Elements with fixed widths were replaced with fluid <code>width:100%</code> or <code>width:auto</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc-optimizations-appcache">Application Cache</h3>

<p>The mobile version of html5rocks uses <a href="/tutorials/appcache/beginner/">Application Cache</a>
to speed up initial load and allows users to read content offline.</p>

<p>When implementing AppCache on your site, it's <strong>very important</strong> that you don't
cache your manifest file (either explicitly in the manifest file itself or implicitly with heavy
cache control headers). If your manifest gets cached by the browser it's a nightmare to debug.
iOS and Android do a particularly good job of caching this file but don't provide a
convenient way to flush the cache like the desktop browsers do.</p>

<p>To prevent said caching for our site, we first set App Engine to never cache manifest files:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
- url: /(.*\.(appcache|manifest))
  static_files: \1
  mime_type: text/cache-manifest
  upload: (.*\.(appcache|manifest))
  expiration: "0s"
</pre>

<p>Second, we used the JS API to inform the user when a new manifest
has finished downloading. They're prompted to refresh the page:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
window.applicationCache.addEventListener('updateready', function(e) {
  if (window.applicationCache.status == window.applicationCache.UPDATEREADY) {
    <strong>window.applicationCache.swapCache();</strong>
    if (confirm('A new version of this site is available. Load it?')) {
      <strong>window.location.reload();</strong>
    }
  }
}, false);
</pre>

<p>To save network traffic keep your manifest simple. That is to say, don't
call out every page on your site. Just list the important images, CSS, and
JavaScript files. The last thing you want to do is force the mobile browser
to download a large number of assets on every appcache update. Instead, remember
that the browser will implicitly cache an html page when the user visits 
(and it includes a <code>&lt;html manifest="..."&gt;</code> attribute).</p>

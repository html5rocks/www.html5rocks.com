  <h2 id="toc-introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>I recently had the pleasure of creating a mobile version of HTML5Rocks and later wrote
  up my experiences in <a href="/mobile/mobifying.html">"Mobifying" Your HTML5 Site</a>.
  In fact, the project was my first real endeavor into mobile web development.
  All in all, I'd say the experiment was a great learning experience. While developing a
  mobile version of this site was fun, the most important takeaway from the challenge
  was what I learned about debugging mobile web apps. Let's be honest. It can be a real PITA!</p>

  <p>The goal of this article is to help steer you in
  the right direction the next time you develop for the mobile web. I'll give you
  the best techniques I discovered when developing mobile html5rocks.com.
  There's probably plenty more that could be covered, but we'll leave that for
  another time :)</p>

  <h2 id="toc-broswer">Your browser says, "Don't forget about me!"</h2>

  <p>The number one tool I found when developing mobile HTML5Rocks was to use the
  desktop web browser to develop and debug mobile web apps. That may or may not be
  obvious to people, but it was not obvious to me.</p>

  <p>Turns out the desktop browser is a fantastic tool for debugging a mobile web app!
  Being an absolute noob, my first instinct was to download the
  <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html">Android SDK + Emulator</a>
  and <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">iOS simulator</a> and fire up
  the site in them. After 5 minutes of putting up with the horrifically slow
  Android emulator, it was clear I needed something better.</p>

  <p>Modern browser include excellent developer tools. In Chrome or Safari,
  you can use the <a href="/tutorials/developertools/part1/">Developer Tools</a>
  to debug JavaScript, inspect DOM elements, and change CSS styles on-the-fly.
  Firefox has Firebug, which has similar capabilities. When I was debugging the site's
  CSS media queries, the Dev Tools became a life saver.</p>

  <h3 id="toc-useragent">Pretending to be something you're not: UA spoofing</h3>

  <p>Sometimes, it's handy to change the browser's User Agent. The obvious reason is to
  more closely mimic the experience of the native device. As an example,
  the App Engine server behind HTML5Rocks omits certain functionality, template sections,
  and site features if the user is visiting on mobile. A boolean <code>true</code>
  is passed to our Django templates if the user is visiting on a smart device (for us: IOS or Android).
  Hence to test the site as mobile Safari (from desktop Safari), some UA spoofing was required.
  Luckily, some browsers make this super easy to do.</p>

  <p>My recommendation is to use Safari for testing User Agent issues, for two reasons:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Safari has User Agent switching built-in.</li>
    <li>A large majority of smart phones are either iOS or Android. Both of these platforms
    use browsers that are Webkit-based. In the context of testing, that means you'll
    be close to the actual device's mobile browser.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To enable the 'Develop' menu in Safari, check 'Show Develop menu in menu bar' under Advanced > Preferences.</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/debuggingwebapps/safari_devmenu.png" width="500" height="255" title="Enabling Safari's Develop menu" alt="Enabling Safari's Develop menu" />
    <figcaption>Enabling Safari's Develop menu</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Under the Develop menu, you can easily switch the browser's UA:</p>

  <figure class="center">
    <img src="/static/images/screenshots/debuggingwebapps/useragent.png" class="border" width="500" height="346" title="Changing the User Agent in Safari" alt="Changing the User Agent in Safari" />
    <figcaption>Changing the User Agent in Safari</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Lastly, for the browser that do not natively support User Agent switching, there
  are some nice plugins available, particularly <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/">for Firefox</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="toc-resize">Sizing things up: testing CSS media queries</h3>

  <p>After <a href="#toc-useragent">switching to a mobile UA</a>, the next piece of the puzzle
  is resize the browser to size of the mobile device. The reason is really two-fold.
  First, you can more optimally visualize and design your site when you know what kind
  of screen real-estate is available. Secondly, testing CSS media queries becomes trivial.
  We actually use media queries <a href="/mobile/mobifying.html#toc-mediaqueries">all over the place</a>
  in the mobile version of html5rocks.com. To see what I mean, start resizing this window.
  The UI should change significantly (especially in the top header) as the page gets smaller.
  Whenever we needed to override a default styling, CSS media queries proved to be invaluable.</p>

  <p>For Android and iPhone, the  screen-size is typically 320px. For iPad, it's more like 768px for portrait and
  1024px for landscape. To save yourself the trouble of manually figuring out the correct size,
  I've created handy bookmarklets to load a page at each size:</p>

  <p id="bookmarklets">
    Drag these bookmarklets to your bookmarks bar:<br>
    <a href="javascript:var w=window.open(document.location.href, 'mywin', 'height=' + document.height + ',width=768');w.resizeTo(768+window.innerWidth-document.body.clientWidth, document.height);">768px (ipad-portratit)</a>
    <a href="javascript:var w=window.open(document.location.href, 'mywin', 'height=' + document.height + ',width=1024');w.resizeTo(1024+window.innerWidth-document.body.clientWidth, document.height);">1024px (ipad-landscape)</a>
    <a href="javascript:var w=window.open(document.location.href, 'mywin', 'height=' + document.height + ',width=320');w.resizeTo(320+window.innerWidth-document.body.clientWidth, document.height);">320px (iPhone/Android)</a>
  </p>

  <p>The unobfuscated code looks something like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
var w = window.open(location.href, 'mywin', 'height=' + document.height + ',width=768');
w.resizeTo(768 + window.innerWidth - document.body.clientWidth, document.height);
</pre>

  <p>The resize takes into account the scrollbar width since they're essentially width=0 on mobile.</p>

  <p>When all is said and done, the desktop browser is but one way to test media queries.
  There are plenty of other tools out there, though. A couple of examples are
  <a href="http://resizemybrowser.com/">resizemybrowser.com</a>
  and <a href="http://markboultondesign.com/tools/index.html">iOS Media Query Previewer</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="toc-emulators">Emulators / simulators</h2>

  <p>This article won't cover downloading and installing the iOS or Android SDKs.
  Apple and Google have great documentation for that at
  <a href="http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action">http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action</a>
  and <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a>, respectively.
  </p>

  <p>At <em>some</em> point you'll need to fire up an emulator to test in the "real deal".
  There's no way around it. In my opinion, there are 3 big emulators that you need to include in your testing workflow:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/mobile/">Opera Mobile Emulator</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action">iOS Simluator</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android Emulator</a></li>
  </ol>

  <p>This is by no means an exhaustive list. A complete list can be found in
  "<a href ="http://www.mobilexweb.com/emulators">Mobile Emulators &amp; Simulators: The Ultimate Guide</a>".</p>

  <h3 id="toc-gae">Keeping it local: testing on localhost</h3>

  <p>Since we're talking web apps here, you'll inevitably have some kind of server
  component to your application...unless you're building a toy :) Accessing a local
  development server is straightforward on the iOS Simulator. Just hit <code>http://localhost</code>
  (or similar) in mobile Safari, and you're off and rolling. Doing the same on the
  Android Emulator is a bit trickier.</p>

  <p>To setup <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html">Android Emulator</a> for testing a local dev server, do the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/devices/managing-avds.html#createavd">Create an Android Virtual Device</a>.
    If you have the Android SDK installed properly, navigate to the "tools/" directory in the SDK,
    and execute "./android" from the command-line. The brings up a nice GUI to the Android Virtual Device Manager.</li>
    <li>Create a new AVD:
      <ul>
        <li>Name: HTML5Mobile</li>
        <li>Name: HTML5Mobile</li>
        <li>Target: Android 2.3 - API Level 9 (or higher)</li>
        <li>Optionally choose an SD Card size, screen resolution, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Click create</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The reason the iOS Simulator is so much easier, is because it is just that, a simulator.
  It uses the host operating system (MacOSX 10.6+) for its network stack, memory, etc.
  Android's emulator is a true emulator. It actually fires up a VM, which also one of the
  core reasons it is painfully slow.</p>

  <h3 id="toc-js">Debugging JavaScript</h3>

  <h2 id="toc-appcache">Debugging Application Cache</h2>

  <p>It is my personal feeling that should be using <a href="/tutorials/appcache/beginner/">AppCache</a> on mobile.
  Not only does it offer users offline content, but it can also speed up the initial load of your site.
  Loading assets from an guaranteed cache is much more reliable than relying on browser caching.
  Our mobile version of HTML5Rocks uses AppCache for both of these reasons.</p>

  <p>That said, developing a mobile app that uses Application Cache can be annoying.
  For example, you may forget it's turned on and wonder why browser refreshes aren't reflecting your changes.
  Clearing the browser cache doesn't help either because AppCache uses its own (magic) storage bin.
  Another problem is that AppCache requires two page refreshes to reflect new changes (one to pull
  download the updated assets and another to actually see the changes).</p>

  <p>To save you some frustration, I have two tips for debugging AppCache:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>DO NOT</b> cache your manifest file.</li>
    <li><b>DO</b> setup event listeners for the <code>updateready</code> event. This will insure
    you're always viewing the latest content.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>1. When implementing AppCache it is extremely important that you don't cache your
  manifest file (either explicitly in the manifest file itself or implicitly with
  heavy cache control headers). If your manifest gets cached by the browser it's a nightmare to debug.
  iOS and Android do a particularly good job of caching this file but don't provide a convenient
  way to flush the cache like the desktop browsers do.</p>

  <p>2. Setting up the page to automatically refresh when a new manifest is available
  saves a bunch of trouble later on. Again, mobile Safari and Android do not provide
  a friendly way to clear the AppCache data on demand. Here is one way to handle this problem:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
window.applicationCache.addEventListener('<b>updateready</b>', function(e) {
  if (window.applicationCache.status == window.applicationCache.UPDATEREADY) {
    <b>window.applicationCache.swapCache();</b>
    if (confirm('A new version of this site is available. Load it?')) {
      <b>window.location.reload();</b>
    }
  }
}, false);
</pre>

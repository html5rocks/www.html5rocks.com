  <h2 id="toc-introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>Today, the most important thing you can do for your site is make sure it
      performs well when visited from a phone or tablet. Read on and learn how
      to optimize your site for the mobile browser using Chrome DevTools and an
      Android device.
  </p>
  <h2 id="toc-why-optimization-matters">Why is Optimizing for the Mobile Web
      so Important?</h2>
  <h3 id="toc-performance">Performance</h3>
  <p>Mobile devices are getting faster CPUs, more RAM, faster GPUs, and faster
      network access as we transition from 2G and 3G to 4G. Despite the drumbeat
      of progress, mobile devices are underpowered when compared to our
      computers. In more concrete terms, loading network resources takes longer,
      unpacking images takes longer, painting the page takes longer, executing
      scripts takes longer. It’s safe to assume that your page runs 5 to 10
      times slower on a mobile device.
  </p>
<h3 id="toc-battery">Battery</h3>
  <p>
  Mobile devices are exclusively battery powered. Users of mobile devices want
  that battery to last as long as possible. A sub-optimal site will drain a
  battery much quicker than needed. Minimize network traffic and reduce paints
  to reduce battery drain. When you fetch a resource, the WiFi or cell radio
  must be on, which drains battery. When the browser paints an element, the CPU
  and GPU usage spikes, which also drains battery.
  </p>
<h3 id="toc-engagement">Engagement</h3>
  <p>
  <span style="font-style:italic">
  “Performance is there to increase the metric that matters most to you. In
  Facebook we care about scrolling. In an A/B test, we slowed down
  scrolling from 60fps down to 30fps. Engagement collapsed. We said okay,
  therefore scrolling matters.”</span> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-WYu_p5rdU">Facebook at Edge Conference</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Mobile users expect to be able to get in and out quickly.
    <span style="font-weight:bold">The fastest site will get the most engagement.

  Chrome ships with a great
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/overview">
      set of developer tools.
    </a>
    This article teaches you how to use these tools to profile your mobile site. If you’re already familiar with Chrome DevTools, great! If not, check these great tutorials:</p>

  </ul>
<p>
Now that you’re caught up, let’s see how to accelerate your mobile site with DevTools. If this is the first time you’ve used Chrome DevTools for Android check out the getting <a href="#toc-starting-guide">
  started guide at the bottom of the article.</a>
  </p>
<h2 id="toc-using-devtools-remotely">Using Chrome DevTools Remotely</h2>
<p>
With your Android device tethered to your computer. In desktop Chrome, navigate
  to <a href="http://localhost:9222">http://localhost:9222</a> and on your
  Android device, open up your site.
  You will be taken to a list of open tabs on your Android device.
  Pick your page from the list of ‘Inspectable pages’.
  </p>
  <img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobileprofiling/inspectable_pages.png"
       title="Inspectable Pages"
       alt="Inspectable Pages" />
  <p>and you will be taken to Chrome DevTools for that page.</p>
  <img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobileprofiling/remote_devtools.png"
       title="Remote DevTools"
       alt="Remote DevTools" />
  <p>Aww.. that familiar Chrome DevTools toolbar is right there.
  <span style="font-weight:bold">The most
  important thing to understand about remote Chrome DevTools is that they are
  the same DevTools you’re using today on your desktop.</span>
  The only difference is
  that your Android device is only responsible for the page, while your desktop
  is responsible for DevTools. <span style="font-weight:bold">Under the hood,
  the same data is collected and the same functionality is available.</span>
  </p>
  <p>As an example, I visited
  <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/movies">www.sfgate.com/movies</a> on my phone.
  Using Chrome DevTools on my desktop I hovered over a
  <span style="font-style:italic">div</span> in the
  <span style="font-weight:bold">Elements tool</span>
  and, just like it is on the desktop, the
  <span style="font-style:italic">div</span> is visually highlighted on my
  Android device.
  </p>
  <img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobileprofiling/sfgate_source.png"
       title="Source Code Snippet"
       alt="Source Code Snippet" />
  <img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobileprofiling/sfgate_highlight.png"
       title="Div Highlighted"
       alt="Div Highlighted" />
  <p>
  The  <span style="font-weight:bold">Elements tool</span> can also be used to
  toggle styles on and off, which will come in handy when we attempt to
  investigate paint times.
  </p>
<h2 id="toc-network">Shedding Light on Network Access</h2>
<p>
Network performance is import, and it’s even more important on the mobile web.
Mobile devices are often on slower connections than our desktop and
laptop computers. To make sure you’re doing the right thing, take a
network snapshot by going to the
<span style="font-weight:bold">Network tool</span> and pressing record.
</p>
<img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobileprofiling/network_tool.png"
       title="Network Tool"
       alt="Network Tool" />
<p>
The screenshot shows the network traffic resulting from a Google search.
Observe the network requests your site makes and find ways to minimize them.
If your site makes polling requests to the server, you may want to pay
attention to user activity and avoid polling when the user has been idle.
The <span style="font-weight:bold">Network tool</span> allows you to view the
raw HTTP headers, useful in case mobile networks are altering them at all.
</p>
<h2 id="toc-optimize-paint-times">Optimizing Paint Times</h2>
<p>
One of the biggest bottlenecks in mobile web browsers is painting your page.
Painting is the process of drawing an element on the page with the specified
styling. When one element is expensive to paint it slows down painting of the
whole page. Chrome makes an attempt at caching previously painted elements in
an offscreen buffer. But, on mobile the amount of GPU RAM available is limited,
limiting the number of elements that can be cached off screen. The side effect
is <span style="font-weight:bold">more paints</span> and
<span style="font-weight:bold">each paint is slower than the desktop.</span>
In order to have responsive scrolling, you must minimize paint times.
</p>
<p>
Chrome 25 includes
<span style="font-weight:bold">continuous page repaint mode.</span>
Continuous page repaint mode never caches painted elements and, instead,
<span style="font-weight:bold">paints all elements each frame</span>. By
forcing all elements to be painted each frame, it is possible to perform A/B
testing of paint times by toggling elements on and off, and styles on and off.
While the process is manual, it’s an invaluable tool for tracking down how
expensive painting each element on your page is. The first rule of optimization
club is <span style="font-weight:bold">measure what you’re trying to optimize
to get a baseline</span>. Let’s work through a simple example.
</p>
<p>First, enable continuous page repaint mode:</p>
<video width="500" controls>
<source src="/static/videos/enable_paint_mode.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
<p>
After enabling, a graph will be visible in the upper right corner of your
Android device. The x-axis of the graph is time, divided into frames. The
y-axis of the graph measures paint time, in milliseconds. You can see that,
on my device, the page takes 14 milliseconds to paint. The minimum and maximum
paint times are also shown along with GPU memory used.
</p>
<img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobileprofiling/graph_before.png"
       width="500" title="Before"
       alt="Before" />
<p>As an experiment, I set the style on the selected element to be
<span style="font-style:italic">“display: none”</span>. Let’s see how expensive
the page is to paint now.
<img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobileprofiling/graph_after.png"
       width="500" title="After"
       alt="After" />
<p>
Paint times went from around 14 milliseconds per frame down to 4 milliseconds
per frame. In other words, painting that one element took approximately 10
milliseconds. By following the process of toggling elements on and off and
styles on and off you can quickly narrow in on the expensive parts of your
page. Remember, faster paint times means less jank, a longer battery and more
engagement from your users. When you’re ready to dig deeper, be sure to read
<a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2013/02/Profiling-Long-Paint-Times-with-DevTools-Continuous-Painting-Mode">
this great article on continuous page repaint mode.</a>
</p>
<h2 id="toc-advanced-features">Advanced Features</h2>
<h3 id="toc-about-tracing">about:tracing</h3>
<p>
Many of the more advanced developer features available in desktop Chrome are
also available in Android Chrome too. For example,
 <span style="font-style:italic">about:gpu-internals</span>,
 <span style="font-style:italic">about:appcache-internals</span>, and
 <span style="font-style:italic">about:net-internals</span> are available.
 When investigating a particularly tricky
problem you sometimes need more data in order to narrow in on the cause of
your problem. On the desktop, you might be using about:tracing. If you’re not
already familiar with <span style="font-style:italic">about:tracing</span>, watch
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8">my video on using and exploring the
<span style="font-style:italic">about:tracing</span> profiling tool</a>. It is
possible to capture the same data from
Android Chrome, follow these steps to get started:
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://github.com/johnmccutchan/adb_trace">adb_trace.py</a></li>
<li>Run adb_trace.py from the command line</li>
<li>Use Chrome on Android</li>
<li>Press enter on the command line, shutting down the adb_trace.py script.</li>
</ol>
After adb_trace.py completes you will have a JSON file that you can load in
desktop Chrome’s <span style="font-style:italic">about:tracing</span>.

<h2 id="toc-starting-guide">Starting Guide</h2>
<p>Now that we've reviewed what remote Chrome DevTools can do, let's cover how
to get started in your remote debugging session. If you haven’t used them
before,
<a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging">
read detailed instructions on how to get started</a>. If you’ve already
used them, but have forgotten exactly how to use them, I’ve listed shortened
instructions here as well.
<h3 id="toc-sg-1">1. Install Android SDK</h3>
You might be wondering why you have to
<a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">install the Android SDK</a>
when you are developing for the web. Included in the SDK is adb (Android Debug Bridge).
Desktop Chrome needs to be able to communicate with your Android device.
Chrome doesn’t talk directly with the Android device, instead it routes
communication through adb.
<img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobileprofiling/adb.png"
       title="ADB bridge"
       alt="ADB bridge" />
<h3 id="toc-sg-1">2. Enable USB debugging on your device</h3>
<img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobileprofiling/enable_usb_debugging.png"
       width="500" title="Enable USB Debugging"
       alt="Enable USB Debugging" />
<p>
The option for enabling USB debugging can be found in Android Settings.
<a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging#enable-usb-debugging">Enable it.</a>
</p>
<h3 id="toc-sg-1">3. Connect to the device</h3>
<p>If you haven’t already, connect your Android device to your desktop via USB.
If this is the first time you’ve used USB debugging you will be given the
following prompt:</p>
<img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobileprofiling/allow_usb_debugging.png"
       width="500" title="Allow USB Debugging"
       alt="Allow USB Debugging" />
<p>If you will be doing remote debug sessions frequently,
I recommend checking ‘Always allow from this computer’. </p>
<h3 id="toc-sg-1">4. Verify that your device is properly connected</h3>
Run <span style="font-style:italic">adb devices</span> from your command prompt.
You should see your device listed.
<h3 id="toc-sg-1">5. Enable USB debugging in Chrome</h3>
<p>
Open <span style="font-weight:bold">Settings > Advanced > DevTools</span> and
check the <span>Enable USB Web debugging</span> option as shown here:
</p>
<img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobileprofiling/chrome_usb_debugging.png"
       width="500" title="Allow USB Debugging"
       alt="Allow USB Debugging" />
<h3 id="toc-sg-1">6. Creating a DevTools connection to your Android device</h3>
<p>
Run the following command:

<p style="font-style:italic">
adb forward tcp:9222 localabstract:chrome_devtools_remote
</p>

creates a bridge between your desktop machine and your Android device via adb.
If you run into any issues getting to this point, read over the detailed setup
instructions <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging">here</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="toc-sg-1">7. Verifying your good to go</h3>
<p>Verify that your device is properly connected by opening Chrome on your
desktop and navigating to
<a href="http://localhost:9222">http://localhost:9222"</a>. If you get a
404, another error, or don’t see something like the following:</p>
<img src="/static/images/screenshots/mobileprofiling/inspectable_pages.png"
       title="Inspectable Pages"
       alt="Inspectable Pages" />
<p>read over the detailed setup instructions
 <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging">here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="toc-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Mobile users are often in a hurry and need to quickly get that important piece of information from your page. It is your duty as a mobile site builder to ensure that the page loads quickly and performs well on mobile. If not, user engagement will drop. Remote Chrome DevTools are functionally equivalent to their desktop counterparts. The UI is similar enough that you don’t need to learn a new set of tools. In other words, your work flow carries over. Remember,
<span style="font-weight:bold">Facebook isn’t invincible to performance problems and your site isn’t either. Performant sites get more user engagement.</span>

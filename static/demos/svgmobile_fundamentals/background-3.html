<h1>Super cool mobile page</h1>
<p>
My phone is the best thing evar! I wouldn't know what to do without it since I found out it has GPS so I'm never lost!
</p>
<p>
The other amazing thing is I can read the web, check my mail and do everything I used to do on my heavy
clunky home PC but now it's something I can throw in my pocket.
</p>
<p>
It really amazes me how much smaller these computer things have become. I'm astounded!
</p>
<p>
Now all I need to do is work out how to make cooler web sites that everyone wants to visit so that I can spread so much know-how!
